Basic Concepts
In this section, we cover the foundational concepts of Low-Rank Adaptation, including theoretical background, mathematical formulations, and simple examples to illustrate the basic principles.

Projects and Implementations
1. ViT with LoRA for Image Classification
This project demonstrates the application of LoRA to Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification tasks. We provide detailed explanations, code, and results for training ViT models with LoRA.

2. Object Detection with LoRA
Here, we explore how LoRA can be utilized in object detection frameworks. The implementation includes model training, evaluation, and comparison with standard object detection models.

3. LoRA in Large Language Models (LLMs)
In this section, we investigate the integration of LoRA into large language models. We provide scripts, notebooks, and analyses on how LoRA affects the performance and efficiency of LLMs.
